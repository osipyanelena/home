    <p>Nyan Cat is the name of an internet meme that stems from a YouTube video. The video combines an upbeat Japanese song, along with an 8-bit animated cat. Nyan Cat has a Pop-Tart body, and is shown gliding through space, with a rainbow trail behind him.</p>
    <p>The original animation was created in 2011 April, by an artist named Chris Torres (alias: prguitarman). The artwork was made as a requested "what-if" combination between a cat and a pop tart. Over the span of the next few days, Nyan Cat was popularized on Tumblr, receiving over 3000 "notes".</p>
    <p>On April 5th, another user had decided to post the animation, synced with a Japanese song called "Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya" (meow repeated over and over). The video recieved over 1 million views in its first two weeks, which was very rare on young YouTube.</p>

    <p>Since then, Nyan Cat had been incorporated into many parts of Internet subculture, due to his nonsensical yet cute appearance.</p>
