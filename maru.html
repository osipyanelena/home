    <p>Maru <i>(Japanese: round; circle)</i> is a male Scottish Fold cat. He has become popular on both Japanese and international YouTube alike, because of his passion for getting into boxes of all sizes. Videos showing Maru had over 325 million views in September 2016, a Guinness World Record for a YouTube channel of a single animal.</p>
    <p>On May 24th, 2007, Maru the Cat was born. A photo blog "I am Maru‚Äù was launched to curate photos of the cat in November of the same year. In July of 2008, Maru's YouTube channel "mugumogu" began uploading short videos of Maru's daily adventures. Since then, the cat has grown to be loved all around the world, with major sites like Buzzfeed writing multiple articles about him.</p>
