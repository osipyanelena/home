    <p>Lil BUB is an Internet celebrity cat from America. As the runt of her litter, born with multiple disabilities, she wasn't expected to even find a permanent home. Yet Mike Bridavsky decided to take in this cat, that soon proved to be a wonder.</p>
    <p>When Bridavsky’s friends reached out to him with the purpose of finding Lil Bub a home, he adopted her. Lil BUB’s photos were first posted to 2011 Tumblr, but they were deleted after a feature on Reddit.</p>

    <p> When she was a year old, she was diagnosed with osteopetrosis, an extremely rare bone condition. So rare, that BUB was the only cat in recorded history to have it.</p>
    <p>She ended up "starting" a charity for animals with disabilities, and has raised over $200 000 worldwide.</p>

    <p>In 2013, Lil BUB has "published" "Lil BUB's Lil Book", which was succesful with thousands of pet lovers. However, she is best known for her autobiography, "Lil BUB & Friendz". It takes the form of an hour-long movie, that depicts the first year and a half of Lil BUB's life. Described as extremely heartwarming, the movie premiered worldwide at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival, proceeding to win "Best Feature Film" award.</p>
    <p> Lil BUB has also hosted multiple Meets and Greets to further promote her charity, and posed for a PETA campaign. She is known as one of the most influential cats in the world. </p>
